## Creating Effective Meetings

⏱️ 20 minutes - Individual


The thought of meetings can send some people into existential dread, either through bad prior experiences or having to deal talking with people for an hour (or longer). Unfortunately, meetings have developed a bad reputation because they are often misused by management, administrators and leaders.

## Universal Meeting Structure and Rules

There is a generalised meeting structure that can be applied to any meeting to improve flow and ensure the meeting achieves all its objectives. Additionally, there are a set of specific general ground rules for meetings to guarantee meeting members and facilitator stay focused and on task. 

### Universal Meeting Structure (Agenda)

- **Purpose**: What does you want to achieve in the meeting? Explicitly stating this will provide context before the meeting begins.
- **Participants**: Who is expected to  be there? Assign a chair (who will run the meeting) and a note-taker.
- **Discussion Points**: What are the topics, issues or problems? Identify who will lead each discussion point.
  ```{tip}
  Research shows that if you write the discussion point item on your agenda as what **outcome** you want from the meeting, it focuses the attendees. So instead of: "Prototype" or even "Discuss prototype features", write the point as: "Identify which features we will prototype".  
  ```
- **Times**: Assign a start time each item, and stick to it! If it is clear this needs more time, 'park' it until the end of the meeting, and defer to another meeting if you don't have time at the end.
- **Action Items**: Those things that need to be done after the meeting. These are things that should go on your team please, such as on Trello. So, an action item should say: **who does what by when?**
- **Supporting Documentation & Materials**: Anything else you need; e.g. if you want to discuss how you are going to assign software features to be implemented by team members, have the list of features.her multimedia. 


Every meeting type will be different, but in general these are the most critical requirements of a meeting. This structure is a suggestion and should be moulded to requirements.

### Universal Meeting Rules

- Pre-publish an agenda: An agenda gives the meeting facilitator and members an idea of what the meeting will be about and what to plan for if they are presenting. This ensures the smooth flow of the meeting and keeps it focused on required aims and goals. The general structure of an agenda will include:
    - Meeting start time.
    - A list of items to be discussed.
    - Start times for each specific item.
    - Meeting end time.
- Start on time: This maintains the integrity of the meeting and holds members accountable, and it is very simple to accomplish. When a meeting is set for a certain time, the meeting must start at that time. There are a few additional rules to ensure the meeting starts on time.
    - Be early: It takes time to settle. If the meeting starts at 1100h, show up 2-3 minutes early so you can settle and prepare yourself.
    - Assign a co-facilitator: Usually the facilitator will kick off the meeting, but there is always a chance they are late, so ensure someone else can take the reigns that being the case.
    - Use a time-keeper: This can either be a smartphone, watch or an assigned member. The time-keeper lets the facilitator know the exact time for the meeting to start.
- Follow the agenda: Don’t deviate from the agenda or allow facilitator / team members to go over their allotted time. Don’t be afraid to cut someone off if they are talking too much. Usually the facilitator will manage this, but if the facilitator does this themselves, the co-facilitator can remind them about time management.
- Use a parking lot: A parking lot is storage for long-winded or off-topic discussions that are not on the agenda. If a member or facilitator is deviating from the agenda, their deviation can be moved to the parking lot for future review in other meeting or privately with those the topic concerns.
- Fix responsibilities: When an agenda item is completed, an execution order needs to be delegated to a team member. Depending on the agenda item, a concrete order of execution needs to be assigned. This may look like a list of things that need to be done and who needs to do them. Assign responsibility and lay out exactly what needs to be done to get to the desired outcome.
- Finish before time: If there are meetings back to back, or a student needs to get to class, or a member has somewhere else to be, give time so they can be at their scheduled appointment. How early to finish depends on the environment. At university, 10 minutes may be the right amount, as a student might need to get to the other side of campus. At a small business office, 5 minutes may be enough. Do not let meetings run over time. Close them out quickly and give members time to prepare for their next scheduled activity or action.
- Publish notes: Notes are not minutes. Minutes are usually a legal requirement and are done by professional stenographers. Notes a memory aid for members when they need to write up their tasks or plan their execution orders. Notes can be written by a dedicated scribe (note-taker) or by members themselves. In Short, notes are simply:
    - What was decided?
    - Who said they would do what and by when?
- Continuously Improve: Be adaptable and evolve. Periodically revisit how your meetings work and whether they are working well. Are the agendas accurate and being followed? Are the ground rules appropriate? Are the right people at the meeting? Is the meeting even needed? Don’t be afraid to experiment or mix things up.
- Use Facilitator/Co-facilitator: A facilitator is not necessarily the manager or leader, they are tasked with running the meeting and could be anyone in the team or organisation. Tasks such as starting, timing, enforcement (cutting people off), notes and follow-ups can be managed by the facilitator (in small teams) or delegated to other members (for big teams / organisations). Often a co-facilitator will be chosen if the facilitator is late, sick or leaves the team / organisation altogether (hand-over). Co-facilitators can also share delegated tasks. Remember, facilitators may be members and also need to contribute to the meeting, if all they are doing is facilitating, their contribution won’t be heard.

## Meeting Agenda Draft

<aside>
⏱️ 30 minutes - Team

</aside>

Now that you have an understanding of meeting types, a general meeting structure and general meeting rules, it is good practice to develop a draft meeting agenda for your first team meeting. 

- [ ]  Take the butchers paper from the previous exercise and flip it around onto the empty side.
- [ ]  Nominate a facilitator for the exercise.
- [ ]  The facilitator draws two equidistant lines across the paper (now you have 3 sections) and titles each section with ‘Meeting Type’, ‘Meeting Structure’ and ‘Meeting Rules’.
- [ ]  From the meeting type list above, each member chooses the most appropriate meeting for the first team meeting agenda, but does not tell anyone what they chose. Instead, each member draws their interpretation (without words) onto a sticky note in 6 minutes or less. Drawn interpretations can use symbols, icons, images and sketches, but no letters, words or numbers.
- [ ]  When complete, place sticky notes into the ‘Meeting Type’ section.
- [ ]  As a team, vote on which sticky note you would like to set as the meeting type, without the author revealing its actual meaning. Once chosen, the author can reveal the intended meeting type and it will be set as the agenda’s meeting type.
- [ ]  Based on the chosen meeting type, use sticky notes to create a specific agenda structure as a team. This should be managed by the facilitator and can be done as delegations or free form. Decide whether you need a basic meeting structure, or if some meeting points in the general structure are not necessary, or if you need more. The end result is up to you.
- [ ]  Once the type and structure have been completed, once again use drawn sticky notes to decide the meeting rules. Try to select them without revealing what the author’s original intent was with the drawing (like in the first stage).
- [ ]  When complete, be sure to make notes (digital or physical) on the outcome so the agenda draft can be drawn up more formally later.

This exercise is only to get the ball rolling. It doesn’t need to represent the final agenda. Use it as a guide and an activity to experiment.

## Discussion

<aside>
⏱️ 5 minutes - Team (table)

</aside>

Discuss your draft agenda with your team members and ask your Legends for feedback. Ensure you have developed an effective meeting agenda draft as you will need to use it in the future. 







## Bonus: It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this.
