Teams are the foundation of innovation. A well-functioning team can overcome obstacles, adapt to challenges, and amplify creativity. However, a poorly functioning team often struggles with conflict, inefficiency, and stagnation. Understanding team roles and planning processes can transform a collection of individuals into a cohesive, high-performing unit.

Throughout history, mankind is continued to iterate on the team development and implementation model ranging from society, to government and to warfare. One of the greatest examples of highly cohesive and effective teams was the roman legion

Throughout history, mankind has continually iterated on team development and implementation models, ranging from society to government and warfare. One of the greatest examples of highly cohesive and effective teams was the Roman legion.

The Roman legion was not just a military force; it was an organizational masterpiece. Each legion, comprising thousands of soldiers, was divided into smaller, specialized units such as centuries and cohorts, each with clear roles and responsibilities. This division allowed for flexibility, adaptability, and precise coordination on the battlefield. Every soldier understood their role and how it contributed to the larger mission, creating a sense of shared purpose and accountability. Leaders within the legion were selected based on merit and experience, fostering trust and respect among the ranks.

What set the Roman legion apart was its emphasis on training, discipline, and communication. Soldiers drilled tirelessly to perfect their formations and manoeuvres, ensuring that they could respond quickly and cohesively to changing conditions. This level of preparation allowed them to outmanoeuvre larger or more chaotic forces. Moreover, the legion's standardized equipment and organizational structure made it easier to replace losses, maintain morale, and sustain long campaigns. These principles of role specialization, rigorous preparation, and effective communication remain fundamental to successful team-based organizations today, offering timeless lessons in teamwork and leadership.

# Myers-Briggs and Teamwork

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) was developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers in the mid-20th century, based on Carl Jung’s theory of psychological types. While initially created for personal development, MBTI quickly gained traction in the workplace for its ability to provide insights into how people think, communicate, and collaborate.

Understanding the diversity of personality types within a team provides a lens to appreciate strengths and anticipate challenges. Whether you’re leading a project or contributing to a team effort, recognizing these dynamics is critical to effective team management.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is built around four key dichotomies: Introversion (I) vs. Extraversion (E), Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N), Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F), and Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P). Together, these traits create 16 unique personality types, each with its own distinct way of processing information, making decisions, and interacting with others. This framework provides a structured yet flexible approach to understanding personality, making it accessible and applicable across various contexts. Importantly, MBTI does not label traits as "good" or "bad" but instead emphasizes how different types contribute unique strengths to a team.

The value of MBTI lies in its ability to foster self-awareness and empathy within teams. By understanding their own preferences, individuals can identify areas where they naturally excel and areas where they may need support. Similarly, by recognizing the traits of their teammates, they can tailor their communication and collaboration strategies to suit different personalities. For example, while an Extravert may thrive in brainstorming sessions, an Introvert might contribute more effectively through reflective planning. By acknowledging these differences, MBTI helps reduce misunderstandings, improve team dynamics, and enable more balanced decision-making. Its enduring popularity stems from its ability to unlock the potential of diverse groups, transforming personality differences into strategic assets.

# Exercise 1: Guess the Type

<aside>
⌛ 30 minutes - Pair or Group

</aside>

> **Objective:** Build curiosity about personality types.
> 

It’s important to remember that MBTI is not a fixed label—it’s a snapshot of your preferences at a particular point in time. As you grow, experience new situations, and develop different skills, your MBTI profile can shift and evolve. Life events, personal growth, and changing priorities often influence how you think, communicate, and make decisions. This fluidity is a strength, reflecting your ability to adapt and expand beyond your natural tendencies. Rather than defining you, MBTI serves as a tool for understanding your journey and how your preferences may develop over time.

If you have taken an MBTI test in the past in a professional or casual setting, the results of that test may be outdated. In the following exercise we will attempt to guess your MBTI, even if you may think you know what your type is or if you have taken the test before.

- [ ]  Form a pair or, if you prefer, you can do this exercise in a group
- [ ]  On a piece of paper, write down your MBTI personality if you have taken the test before, or if you haven’t write down a guess of which personality you believe you fit. Make sure your partner or group do not see what you have written.
- [ ]  Your partner or the group will then ask the following questions. Note down your answers to start building your profile.
- **Introversion (I) vs. Extraversion (E):**
    - Are you someone who recharges by spending time alone or with a small group? That’s **Introversion**.
    - Or do you feel energized when you’re around people, engaging in conversation and activity? That’s **Extraversion**.
- **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):**
    - Do you prefer focusing on facts, details, and things you can see and touch? That’s **Sensing**.
    - Or do you enjoy looking at possibilities, big-picture ideas, and patterns? That’s **Intuition**.
- **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):**
    - When you make decisions, do you lean on logic and objective reasoning? That’s **Thinking**.
    - Or do you tend to prioritize values, emotions, and how decisions affect people? That’s **Feeling**.
- **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):**
    - Do you prefer to have structure, plans, and everything organized? That’s **Judging**.
    - Or do you like to keep things flexible, adaptable, and open-ended? That’s **Perceiving**.
- [ ]  Think about the following questions and discuss with your partner or group which of these four aspects apply to you. Write them down on your piece of paper.
- [ ]  Consider the following examples of MBTI personalities and decide whether your personality fits with these famous individuals.

# Effective Team Structure

<aside>
⏱️

10 minutes - Class

</aside>

A well-structured team is the backbone of any successful project. Team hierarchy and defined roles are not just formalities; they are essential tools that ensure clarity, efficiency, and accountability. When everyone understands their responsibilities and how they fit into the larger framework, collaboration becomes more seamless, and decision-making is faster and more effective.

Effective team structures foster a balance of leadership and delegation. A clear hierarchy helps avoid confusion by providing a chain of command for decisions and conflict resolution, while defined roles ensure that tasks are distributed according to individual strengths and expertise. Without these elements, teams risk duplication of effort, overlooked tasks, or conflicting priorities; all of which can derail a project.

Ultimately, team structure directly impacts project outcomes. Teams with clear roles and a functional hierarchy are better equipped to adapt to challenges, align their goals, and achieve results efficiently. Whether it’s a small group or a large organization, structuring the team properly lays the foundation for innovation and success.

# Exercise 2: SMEAC

<aside>
⌛ 30 minutes - Team

</aside>

SMEAC is a structured planning and communication tool commonly used in military and tactical environments but also highly effective in project management and team operations. It stands for **Situation, Mission, Execution, Administration, and Command** and provides a framework to ensure clear, concise, and actionable plans.

---

### **1. Situation**

This is where you set the stage.

- **What’s happening?** Clearly outline the current conditions and context of the task or operation.
- Include relevant background information, challenges, and any factors that may affect the mission.
- Example: "The team is behind schedule on delivering a key component due to resource constraints."

---

### **2. Mission**

The mission defines the objective—the "what" and "why."

- **What needs to be achieved?** Keep it concise and specific.
- The mission statement should be actionable and align with the team’s goals.
- Example: "Deliver a functional prototype to the client by the end of the month to secure the next phase of funding."

---

### **3. Execution**

Here’s the **"how"** of the plan.

- Outline the steps, strategies, and assignments required to accomplish the mission.
- Include timelines, priorities, and contingency plans.
- Example: "Divide the team into two groups: one focused on prototyping hardware, the other on finalizing software integration. Daily stand-ups will track progress and address blockers."

---

### **4. Administration**

This section covers resources, logistics, and support.

- **What do we need?** List tools, personnel, and other assets required for success.
- Address logistics like deadlines, budgets, and communication channels.
- Example: "Allocate additional budget for expedited shipping of materials. Ensure key team members are available for client reviews."

---

### **5. Command**

This is the chain of command and communication protocols.

- **Who’s in charge?** Clearly define roles, responsibilities, and points of contact.
- Establish escalation protocols for issues or changes in the plan.
- Example: "The project manager is responsible for overall delivery, while team leads will handle specific tasks. Escalate any delays or risks directly to the project manager."

Using SMEAC ensures that plans are clear, comprehensive, and easy to follow. It eliminates ambiguity, reduces errors, and enhances coordination by providing a structured approach to organizing tasks and responsibilities. Whether in high-stakes operations or collaborative projects, SMEAC is a powerful tool to keep teams aligned and focused on their goals.
