## Know thyself

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes - Individual

</aside>

Ask yourself a few questions to understand your needs and goals.

### What is your current skill level?

- Do you have any experience working in teams or in software innovation?
    - Have you worked in the industry?
    - Have you been part of a team casually or professionally?
    - Have you developed an innovative solution, algorithm, function or software?
    - Have you been part of a sports team or hobby group?
    - Are you fresh out of high school or have you spent several decades working?
- What did you do before this course?

Think about these questions and how they will impact your participation in this course.

## Nothing in Excess

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes - Individual

</aside>

Decide how you plan on approaching the course based on your thoughts from the previous exercise. Consider if you are:

- **Beginner (limited team and innovation experience):**
    - Ensure you immerse yourself in course content including seminar and workshops.
    - If you miss a seminar or a workshop, make sure you revise them in your own time before the next session.
    - Don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed, the Course Coordinator and Legends are available to answer questions, chat and break down course content. Feel free to discuss your progress with the teaching team.
    - Focus on producing consistent and incremental progress, rather then shooting for overly ambitious goals and not producing any results.
- **Intermediate (some team and innovation experience):**
    - All of the above, in addition to‚Ä¶
    - Identifying your skills and capabilities early, and considering what you can bring to the team.
    - Being proactive with your team and taking the initiative with tasks and activities.
    - Starting to think about innovative software design and development ideas, and how you could implement them in the timeframe of a semester.
- **Advanced (extensive team and innovation experience):**
    - All of the above, in addition to‚Ä¶
    - Reaching out to your peers to enhance course content and share your knowledge and experience.
    - Seeking out beginners to balance out team composition.
    - Leading by example to develop your leadership and mentorship skills.

Be aware that your learning approach or level may develop during the course of the semester. Re-evaluate yourself based on your progress during the semester and don‚Äôt be afraid to push your own boundaries.

## Give a Pledge when Trouble is at Hand

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes - Class

</aside>

Equipped with the knowledge and tools from the previous two exercises, bring your attention to the people immediately around you, perhaps at your table or close by. Take a moment to introduce yourself to them considering:

- Your current skill level,
- Your learning approach to this course,
- And, which capabilities you most strongly bring to a team.

Be aware the time and prepare your statement beforehand. You only have 1 minute to introduce yourself. Additionally, ensure everyone gets a chance to speak and be mindful of taking up too much time.

# Exercise 2: Understanding the Growth Mindset

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 50 minutes - Individual & Group

</aside>

## Background

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 20 minutes - Individual

</aside>

According to Carol Dweck, individuals are placed on a spectrum according to their implicit beliefs about the origins of ability and capabilities; those that believe that success is based on innate ability are described as having a ‚Äòfixed‚Äô theory of intelligence (fixed mindset), while those that believe their success is based on training, learning and hard work are described as having a ‚Äògrowth‚Äô theory of intelligence (growth mindset). In 2012, Dweck defined the growth mindsets in an interview:

> In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that's that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.

## Mindset Diagnostic Test

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes - Individual

</aside>

Now that you have developed an understanding of the growth mindset, we will use the link below to gauge where your personal mindset falls on the mindset spectrum. Once you have completed the test, reflect on the outcome and ask yourself whether you want to change your mindset or whether you are comfortable the way you are now.

## Awareness Circle

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 20 minutes  - Group (6 - 9)

</aside>

At your table or with people around you, conduct a group exercise called the ‚ÄòAwareness Circle‚Äô to gain an understanding of your fellow students‚Äô mindsets. Follow the steps below. If you have any questions, ask the Legends for guidance on this activity:

- [ ]  Form groups at your table or with nearby students of between 6 to 9 students
- [ ]  Stand up and form a circle in an empty space. Ensure the centre of the circle is empty and that there aren‚Äôt any hazards or obstacles within the circle.
- [ ]  Choose one member of the group to ask questions and after each prompt, move to the centre of the circle depending on how strongly you feel the question applies to you (moving to the centre means the question strongly applies to you, taking just a step means the question doesn‚Äôt apply to you much, not moving at all means the question either doesn‚Äôt apply to you or you do not wish to answer)
- [ ]  Take a little time to observe the other students and how strongly the question applied to them. Take mental notes for future reference.
- [ ]  After each question, reset your positions by moving back to the outer perimeter of the circle.
- [ ]  Upon completing all the questions, sit back down and continue with the next exercise.

Consider who may be a good fit for your current mindset. Remember that matching mindsets may not necessarily be a good fit, as two individuals with high growth mindsets may cause friction in a team. A balanced team can often be the result of a balanced number of mindsets, and mindsets often fall on a spectrum, so there is a good chance that your future team may be comprised entirely of mixed mindsets, which is not necessarily a drawback. 

For reference, these are the questions for this exercise. 

<aside>
‚ùî Do you believe that you can develop your abilities and intelligence through hard work and dedication, or were your the limits of your capabilities set at birth?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùì Do you embrace challenges and view them as opportunities for growth and learning, or do you prefer to avoid difficult tasks and take it easy?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùî Do you persist in the face of obstacles and setbacks, rather than giving up easily?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùì Do you find inspiration and motivation in the success of others, or does the success of others demotivate you?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùî Do you welcome feedback and use it as a tool for improvement, or would you rather avoid critique?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùì Do you believe that effort and persistence are key to success, rather than relying on innate talent or ability?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùî Do you see failure as a natural part of the learning process, rather than a reflection of your abilities?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùì Do you believe that you can learn from others and seek out advice and mentorship, or do you think we can only achieve change from ourselves?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùî Do you believe that your potential is unlimited and can be developed over time, or is your growth capped by some metric?

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùì Do you view challenges and setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as threats to your self-esteem?

</aside>

## Discussion

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes - Group (table)

</aside>

Use this time to reflect on the growth mindset, the exercises and your personal feelings regarding your own mindset. Speak with your fellow students, or make notes, or take the opportunity to ask questions to the Legends roaming the room.

### The Success Paradox

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I)

Sometimes success is not about how hard you try, but by being in the right place, at the right time. 

### Process Focus

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq8-9jSCJr8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq8-9jSCJr8)

Innovation can often end in failure, but if the focus shifts away from the outcome, success may just be around the next pivot.

### Failing Forward - John C. Maxwell
