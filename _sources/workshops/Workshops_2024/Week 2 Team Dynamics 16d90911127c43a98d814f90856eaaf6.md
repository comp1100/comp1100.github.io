# Exercise 1: Identifying and Ratifying Team Values

<aside>
⏱️ 10 minutes - Class

</aside>

> Your beliefs become your thoughts. Your thoughts become your words. Your words become your actions. Your actions become your habits. Your habits become your values. Your values become your destiny. - Mahatma Gandhi (1869 - 1948)
> 

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed non-violent resistance to lead a successful campaign for India’s independence from British rule. He was later given the honorific Mahatma (’great-souled / venerable’ from Sanskrit) in 1914, which is now the common name which is often used to refer to his great achievements.

Gandhi’s understanding of law, culture and the human psyche lead him to develop a deep mastery of shared values and leverage that knowledge to connect a nation together into a cohesive movement. A team is just a micro perspective of a society, country or nation, and agreed values are often shared between the former and latter, only in the extent of scale. 

![1b6db395a7b5b0a97239939a9acace52.webp](Week%202%20Team%20Dynamics%2016d90911127c43a98d814f90856eaaf6/1b6db395a7b5b0a97239939a9acace52.webp)

 

Values underpin how we work and interact with others. As a society, our values influence our laws and define what we, as a collective, accept to correct and incorrect behaviour and actions. On a smaller scale, a cohesive team requires shared values and beliefs that all team members agree on. This must take the form of a social contract, as we can only wilfully act on a set of behaviours we have formally consented to. This forms a critical part of the ratification process of team values, as they need to be identified first.

Simon Sinek is an American author and speaker who is known in entrepreneurial circles for his knowledge of leadership and teams. He makes astute observations on desirable team values.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP9jpxitfb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP9jpxitfb4)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yE541BY-1c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yE541BY-1c)

In these videos, Sinek identifies two critical team values, belief (trust) and support (encourage). He also makes an important observation about making values verbs so they can become actionable. Specifically, we should focus on observable behaviour as much as possible. That way, we can easily tell whether we are adhering to our team’s values. A value such as ‘be thoughtful’ is not helpful, because it is difficult to tell whether someone is being thoughtful (except by referring to specific observable behaviour that demonstrates it). Instead, stating, “show up on time”, “email the team if we will miss a meeting” are very easy to observe, and therefore, we can say whether we are adhering to the values”. In general, avoid using nouns for your team values, instead think about actionable verbs. Believe and encourage are highly desirable actions in a team environment and core building blocks for an effective team. Your team needs may vary, but these are good starter ‘team values’ to get the ball rolling.

⏱️ 30 minutes - Group

There are two problems you will solve with this exercise:

1. Identifying effective values for your team
2. Ratifying those values into a written contract (signing or giving formal consent to a contract or agreement)

The legends will provide butchers paper and markers for each group. Follow these steps to complete the exercise:

- [ ]  Select one group member either through volunteering or vote.
- [ ]  This group member will draw an 6x6 grid on the butchers paper (ensure there is some space on the margins to write)
- [ ]  As a group, start brainstorming team values and writing them on the margins.
- [ ]  Once every member has thought of 6-10 values (as verbs), each member gets to choose any value written in the margin and write them in a single square in the grid (can be any square). Go around the group round-robin, allowing each member to place a value in the grid until the entire grid is filled.
- [ ]  Distribute 9 stickers to each group member (3 of each colour; green, yellow, red)
- [ ]  Place the stickers on the grid (try not to cover the words, but keep them in the square), with green stickers representing the value that are most important to you and red representing values that are least important. Yellow represents values that you are willing to follow, but don’t feel strongly about.
- [ ]  Once all the stickers are placed, analyse the grid and decide on six core values. (Green stickers are worth 1 point, yellow worth 0 points and red worth -1 point; values are ranked by number of points)
- [ ]  Circle core values and rank them by number (1 for highest to 6 for lowest)

Once your group has completed the task, move onto the next task.

## Ratification Process

<aside>
⏱️ 10 minutes - Group

</aside>

With team values having been identified, chosen and ranked, discuss and write up a short 1 page sample of a team contract. A team contract outlines the standards that are expected to be met by all team members during the team’s time together. Utilise the core values to serve as a foundation for this document. You are free to come up with rules of conduct, conflict resolution, communication and other team obligations, but these are just examples. Use your creativity and experience to come up with a novel and interesting team contract.

If you are having trouble coming up with a team contract, do some research on team contract templates and adapt them to your needs. If your team doesn’t complete this team contract in the session or if you don’t have a team yet, use the additional time after the workshop to complete it or do it as homework.

Team contracts serve as insurance for team conflict resolution and issues. They may never be used in a cohesive and well integrated team, but are invaluable when issues arise.

If you are struggling, you can utilise the core values to serve as a foundation for the document. Remember, focus on verbs / behaviours.

# Exercise 2: Creating Effective Meetings

<aside>
⏱️ 18 minutes - Individual

</aside>

The thought of meetings can send some people into existential dread, either through bad prior experiences or having to deal talking with people for an hour (or longer). Unfortunately, meetings have developed a bad reputation because they are often misused by management, administrators and leaders. Additionally, there are different types of meetings for various use cases, which are listed below:

![9bc6b2d208c245f73471773a96ea85b0b677de95-3600x1890.jpeg](Week%202%20Team%20Dynamics%2016d90911127c43a98d814f90856eaaf6/9bc6b2d208c245f73471773a96ea85b0b677de95-3600x1890.jpeg)

### Cadence Meetings

Cadence meetings involve existing groups and teams executing on known work or tasks. They maintain the shape of the organisation in its current state and are usually held at regular intervals. 

- Team Cadence
    
    A cadence meeting, often also termed a stand-up or huddle, is a short meeting in which each team member shares their current task status and near future goals. It’s purpose is to inform the team of progress and to maintain focus on current goals.
    
- Progress Check
    
    Progress check meetings are a review of project milestones and can often include updating project managers with progress, sharing a portfolio or updating stakeholders. Unlike a team cadence, progress checks are not at regular intervals, but scheduled in advance relative to milestones.
    
- One-on-One
    
    One-on-One meetings can include face-to-face meetings with managers, coaching sessions, mentoring or short catch-up sessions. Often a way to gauge team member status or to develop required skills and abilities.
    
- Action Review
    
    An action review is essentially a briefing or debriefing for a specific task. This can come in the form of a retrospective debriefing, a win/loss review or a pre-action review. 
    
- Governance Cadence
    
    Governance cadence meetings are macro organisational meetings including board meetings, quarterly strategy meetings or a quarterly business review. The cover strategic business planning and reviews. 
    

### Catalyst Meetings

Catalyst meetings are scheduled as needed and can often be run or facilitated by subject matter experts, instead of managers and leaders. They often deal with exploration, problem solving or development.

- Idea Generation (Brainstorming / Ideation)
    
    Ideation meetings are all about coming up with new ideas, solutions and innovations. Can include brainstorming sessions, mind-maps, sketching, storyboards and so on.
    
- Planning
    
    Planning meetings lay out a future structure for a project, product, campaign or event. 
    
- Workshop
    
    Workshops come in a variety of styles and structures and can include design workshops, team building exercises, value stream mapping, chartering or a kick-off. 
    
- Problem Solving
    
    Problem solving meetings are usually focused on a specific resolution or goal and can include root-cause resolutions, incident responses and plan resets.
    
- Decision Making
    
    Decision making meetings are larger organisational meetings that deal with strategic opportunity selection, candidate selections and final approvals for a variety of administrative or management decisions.
    

### Context Meetings

Context meetings are designed to transfer information and intention from on person or group to another. They will involve two distinct groups, i.e. trainer and trainee, lecturer and students and so on. 

- Sense-making
    
    Sense-making meetings revolve around finding information or discovery. These can include investigations, informational interviews, market research, user testing or discovery activities. 
    
- Introductions
    
    Introductions are meetings in which both parties are meeting for the first time, this includes sales calls, first interviews, new hire introductions and investor pitches.
    
- Issue Resolution
    
    Issue resolution meetings are the final step in conflict resolution, such as support escalations, contract negotiations and dispute resolutions. These meetings are formal and often recorded.
    
- Community of Practice
    
    Community of practice meetings involve more informal organisations and groups to come together to discuss their needs and goals. These can include community meetups, safety committees and community watch meetings.
    
- Training
    
    Training meetings focus on delivering skills and knowledge. They can include skills certification, new hire training and client training.
    
- Broadcast
    
    Broadcast meetings are generally aimed at whole organisations and can be large events. These can include webinars, press briefings or all-hands meetings.

## Universal Meeting Structure and Rules

There is a generalised meeting structure that can be applied to any meeting to improve flow and ensure the meeting achieves all its objectives. Additionally, there are a set of specific general ground rules for meetings to guarantee meeting members and facilitator stay focused and on task. 

### Universal Meeting Structure (Agenda)

- Purpose
    
    The meeting purpose informs all members of the meeting as to the meeting’s objectives and it’s primary purpose. It will also establish a goal or desired outcome for the meeting. This will provide context before the meeting begins.
    
- Participants
    
    The meeting participants are a list of members expected to attend the meeting including their roles and responsibilities. During this section, members are informed as to who is the facilitator, co-facilitator, scribe (note-taker), presenters and other stakeholders.
    
- Discussion Points
    
    The primary purpose of the meeting is to resolve discussion points, which could range from a variety of topics, issues or problems (drawn from the meeting type). This will also include which members are responsible for those items and will usually know beforehand so they can prepare and have a part during that section of the meeting.
    
- Timeframes
    
    Timeframes indicate how long a section of the meeting will last. These are strict and should be enforced. Members who exceed their allotted time need to be cut off and their points parked.
    
- Action Items
    
    Action items are lists of tasks that need to be done after the meeting. These action items require deadlines and execution orders. This ensures that the meetings outcomes are implemented and that members are accountable and productive.
    
- Supporting Documentation & Materials
    
    Supporting documentation or materials are additional props that can be used to make the meeting more engaging and can include slideshows, videos, presentations , data, wireframes prototypes or other multimedia. 
    

Every meeting type will be different, but in general these are the most critical requirements of a meeting. This structure is just a serving suggestion and should be moulded to requirements. Not every meeting will require all these points in this order, but they serve as a guide to creating effective meetings.

### Universal Meeting Rules

- Pre-publish an agenda: An agenda gives the meeting facilitator and members an idea of what the meeting will be about and what to plan for if they are presenting. This ensures the smooth flow of the meeting and keeps it focused on required aims and goals. The general structure of an agenda will include:
    - Meeting start time.
    - A list of items to be discussed.
    - Start times for each specific item.
    - Meeting end time.
- Start on time: This maintains the integrity of the meeting and holds members accountable, and it is very simple to accomplish. When a meeting is set for a certain time, the meeting must start at that time. There are a few additional rules to ensure the meeting starts on time.
    - Be early: It takes time to settle. If the meeting starts at 1100h, show up 2-3 minutes early so you can settle and prepare yourself.
    - Assign a co-facilitator: Usually the facilitator will kick off the meeting, but there is always a chance they are late, so ensure someone else can take the reigns that being the case.
    - Use a time-keeper: This can either be a smartphone, watch or an assigned member. The time-keeper lets the facilitator know the exact time for the meeting to start.
- Follow the agenda: Don’t deviate from the agenda or allow facilitator / team members to go over their allotted time. Don’t be afraid to cut someone off if they are talking too much. Usually the facilitator will manage this, but if the facilitator does this themselves, the co-facilitator can remind them about time management.
- Use a parking lot: A parking lot is storage for long-winded or off-topic discussions that are not on the agenda. If a member or facilitator is deviating from the agenda, their deviation can be moved to the parking lot for future review in other meeting or privately with those the topic concerns.
- Fix responsibilities: When an agenda item is completed, an execution order needs to be delegated to a team member. Depending on the agenda item, a concrete order of execution needs to be assigned. This may look like a list of things that need to be done and who needs to do them. Assign responsibility and lay out exactly what needs to be done to get to the desired outcome.
- Finish before time: If there are meetings back to back, or a student needs to get to class, or a member has somewhere else to be, give time so they can be at their scheduled appointment. How early to finish depends on the environment. At university, 10 minutes may be the right amount, as a student might need to get to the other side of campus. At a small business office, 5 minutes may be enough. Do not let meetings run over time. Close them out quickly and give members time to prepare for their next scheduled activity or action.
- Publish notes: Notes are not minutes. Minutes are usually a legal requirement and are done by professional stenographers. Notes a memory aid for members when they need to write up their tasks or plan their execution orders. Notes can be written by a dedicated scribe (note-taker) or by members themselves. In Short, notes are simply:
    - What was decided?
    - Who said they would do what and by when?
- Continuously Improve: Be adaptable and evolve. Periodically revisit how your meetings work and whether they are working well. Are the agendas accurate and being followed? Are the ground rules appropriate? Are the right people at the meeting? Is the meeting even needed? Don’t be afraid to experiment or mix things up.
- Use Facilitator/Co-facilitator: A facilitator is not necessarily the manager or leader, they are tasked with running the meeting and could be anyone in the team or organisation. Tasks such as starting, timing, enforcement (cutting people off), notes and follow-ups can be managed by the facilitator (in small teams) or delegated to other members (for big teams / organisations). Often a co-facilitator will be chosen if the facilitator is late, sick or leaves the team / organisation altogether (hand-over). Co-facilitators can also share delegated tasks. Remember, facilitators may be members and also need to contribute to the meeting, if all they are doing is facilitating, their contribution won’t be heard.

## Meeting Agenda Draft

<aside>
⏱️ 30 minutes - Team

</aside>

Now that you have an understanding of meeting types, a general meeting structure and general meeting rules, it is good practice to develop a draft meeting agenda for your first team meeting. 

- [ ]  Take the butchers paper from the previous exercise and flip it around onto the empty side.
- [ ]  Nominate a facilitator for the exercise.
- [ ]  The facilitator draws two equidistant lines across the paper (now you have 3 sections) and titles each section with ‘Meeting Type’, ‘Meeting Structure’ and ‘Meeting Rules’.
- [ ]  From the meeting type list above, each member chooses the most appropriate meeting for the first team meeting agenda, but does not tell anyone what they chose. Instead, each member draws their interpretation (without words) onto a sticky note in 6 minutes or less. Drawn interpretations can use symbols, icons, images and sketches, but no letters, words or numbers.
- [ ]  When complete, place sticky notes into the ‘Meeting Type’ section.
- [ ]  As a team, vote on which sticky note you would like to set as the meeting type, without the author revealing its actual meaning. Once chosen, the author can reveal the intended meeting type and it will be set as the agenda’s meeting type.
- [ ]  Based on the chosen meeting type, use sticky notes to create a specific agenda structure as a team. This should be managed by the facilitator and can be done as delegations or free form. Decide whether you need a basic meeting structure, or if some meeting points in the general structure are not necessary, or if you need more. The end result is up to you.
- [ ]  Once the type and structure have been completed, once again use drawn sticky notes to decide the meeting rules. Try to select them without revealing what the author’s original intent was with the drawing (like in the first stage).
- [ ]  When complete, be sure to make notes (digital or physical) on the outcome so the agenda draft can be drawn up more formally later.

This exercise is only to get the ball rolling. It doesn’t need to represent the final agenda. Use it as a guide and an activity to experiment.

## Discussion
