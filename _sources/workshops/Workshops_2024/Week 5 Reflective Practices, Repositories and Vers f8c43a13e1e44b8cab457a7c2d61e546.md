# Gibbs‚Äô Reflective Cycle (GRC)

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes - Class

</aside>

The foundational principle of personal growth is learning from mistakes. This self-reflection allows us to witness and evaluate our own cognitive, emotional and behavioural processes to optimise future performance or to avoid past failures. Self-reflection depends on a range of functions including introspection and metacognition, which begin to develop in infancy and continue to evolve as we age. Self-reflection is particularly important in professional practice as it allows us to continually improve our performance over our professional careers or vocations.

Graham Gibbs developed a self-reflection framework called ‚ÄòGibbs‚Äô Reflective Cycle‚Äô in 1988 to give structure to learning from experiences. This is one of the most famous cyclical models of reflection and is used pervasively in professional settings. The structure is circular and a closed loop:

- **Description**¬†of the experience
- **Feelings**¬†and thoughts about the experience
- **Evaluation**¬†of the experience, both good and bad
- **Analysis**¬†to make sense of the situation
- **Conclusion**¬†about what you learned and what you could have done differently
- **Action plan**¬†for how you would deal with similar situations in the future, or general changes you might find appropriate.

The action plan bleeds into the description of the next experience. The idea is that it‚Äôs a feedback loop, continually optimising the experience for the most effective and efficient outcome.

### Understanding GRC

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes - Individual

</aside>

Read through the following article (linked below) and take some notes on GRC. Make sure you understand the framework and can apply it as it will be needed for the next exercise.

### Refine your understanding

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes - Group

</aside>

As a group, briefly discuss your understanding of GRC and share your notes. If you find similarities in your notes within your group, try to generalise your notes. If there are significant differences, rationalise the inclusion of those differences and try to come to a consensus to what is important to know about GRC and what information is superfluous. 

## Exercise: Applying GRC to weeks 1 - 4

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 30 minutes - Group, Individual and Pair

</aside>

This exercise involves implementing the GRC in a real world scenario, then reflecting on those learnings and adapting to new situations.

- [ ]  On a post-it note, individually select six questions from any of the ‚Äòhelpful questions‚Äô in the GRC article, one of each of the six stages (description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, conclusion, action plan) or write your own. These questions can come directly from the GRC article, or you can reword them or develop your own. Remember, the six questions need to match each of the six stages and they should flow with each other. The purpose of this exercise is to make a coherent set of questions that encompasses the full cycle of the GRC.
- [ ]  Once you have completed your six questions, with your group, number each post-it note from 1 to X (depending on how many people in your group). Depending on the number of your post-it note, follow the instructions below:
- [ ]  **Odd number:** If your post-it note is odd, stand up and move to another table. Pair up with another person who has an even numbered post-it note. You will ask the other person the six questions on your post-it note. Once they have finished, swap notes, stay seated and raise your hand.
- [ ]  **Even number:** If your post-it note is even, raise your hand and wait at your table for another person to approach you and pair up. Only take questions from an even numbered post-it note holder. Lower your hand when you start a session. When you answer the questions, relate it to a specific reflection from the past 1-4 weeks in COMP1100. After you answer all the questions, swap post-it notes and move on to another table.
- [ ]  Odd holders will always ask questions and even holders will always answer. After each session, even and odd holders will always swap post-it notes, thus changing their roles. Aim for 5 minutes per session. With change overs, you should manage 4 question and answer sessions.

Once the activity time is up take your post-it note and stick it on the whiteboard at the front of the class.

# Repositories and GitHub

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes - Class

</aside>

Filing systems have been a critical part of data management since antiquity, but today we have done away with folders, filing cabinets and boxes, and have replaced them with online repositories. There are a huge number of online storage options, but for this course we will focus on using GitHub as it also allows sharing and modifying code on different branches using merge, push and pull requests.

GitHub is a developer platform that allows users to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git, a distribution version control system to track versions of files. GitHub is a company that provides a browser or desktop based user interface for Git. There are many ways to use Git, and there are other companies that provide Git services, but GitHub is one of the more popular services. In this course we will only provide tutorials and help for GitHub, but you are free to use any Git service under the caveat that staff cannot help you with problems and you will need to deal with it yourself. 

GitHub has expanded its functionality and is now also a very effective tool for project management and file storage. Just be aware that GitHub cannot handle large files, so use another storage service for anything above 100mb.

## Setting up a GitHub Repository

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes - Group

</aside>

In your groups, watch the following video and setup a GitHub repository. Make sure every member is added to the project and either create or upload a few test files to get an understanding of how GitHub works and how you can use it to store project files.

## Adding Files and Managing Directories

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes - Group

</aside>

GitHub repos, like any file storage, requires a logical file structure. Try to complete the following tasks:

- [ ]  Create a new folder
- [ ]  Upload the Team Values, created in a previous workshop or in your own time, to the repository into the new folder
- [ ]  Create a new folder called interviews and add sub-folders for each team member
- [ ]  Upload team member interviews as plain text in the sub-folders

## Understanding Branch, Merge and Pull Requests

In this exercise, we will learn how to branch, merge and create pull requests. Follow the tutorials below, then upload your personal development goals to your own branch and merge it with the groups repository.

## Managing Conflicts

Occasionally, you will run into merge conflicts. These can be reviewed manually or resolved automatically. For best practices, ensure you review this conflicts manually, so not data gets lost or overwritten. For our use case, it is unlikely you will run into merge conflicts (unless two people name two files the same thing in the same folder), but it‚Äôs better to be prepared. 

The challenge for this task is to create an artificial merge conflict. You can do these a variety of ways. Use your own creativity to come up with a merge conflict and show it to your Legend.

Below is a video that will explain merge conflicts, how to avoid them and how to resolve them.
