# Weeks 12: Course Surveys, and making progress on your MVPs

## Course surveys

⏱️ 5-10 minutes - Individual

Please take 5-10 mins at the start of the studio to fill out the course survey:


````{list-table}

* - [COMP1100](https://go.blueja.io/8ql4GAiqTEadVQph0awwmQ)
   - [COMP7110](https://go.blueja.io/HDKXXk2Wrk2061DRtSOJ8Q)
* - ![](./figs/COMP1100_SECaT_QR_code.png)
   - ![](./figs/COMP7110_SECaT_QR_code.png)
````

In the written feedback, there are two main questions we'd love you to answer:

1. List (at most) three things that you think absolutely should stay in COMP1100/7110.
2. List (at most) three things that you have seen done in other courses that you would like to see adopted in COMP1100/7110.

Remember: asking for change is good, but note that anything that gets 'added' to the course, requires something else to be removed. So, do make sure to let us know what you think should stay.

```{note}
We realise that filling out a survey about a course that you will never do again (we hope!) may seem a waste of time. But if we complain about our courses, and then don't fil out the surveys, we are the problem. The reason there is something you don't like in your course may be simply that past students didn't take the time to let the course coordinator know. Collectively, UQ students can help us improve their overall experience by doing this.
```


Here are a few things that we often get asked, but which we will NOT be changing:
* More reminders about upcoming deadlines: Deadlines are published on the course profile, discussd in seminars, and remiders are sent in the weekly update. Other than this, students are expected to manage their own planning.
* More detail about what to do in each submission: We aim to replicate a professional workplace/environment in COMP1100/COMP7110. In professional workplaces, people are expected to read and define their own quality indicators (to an extend). The 13 competencies are the rubric for COMP1100/7110, and how to achieve them is given in the notes, the studios, the seminars, or a combination of all three.
* Clear expectations about future weeks: Reminder that this is published in the [schedule](https://comp1100.github.io/intro.html#schedule)
* Allow students to do online surveys instead of interviews: No, no, no! Surveys are a poor replacement for interviews. They lack context, storytelling, and the ability to learn NEW things; as discussed in the [chapter on interviews](sec:interviews).
* Change to a 1-7 instead of pass/fail so students put in effort: The pass/fail is done because, for many people, this is the first experience working in a professional team. Our experience shows that when grades are on the line, individuals often sacrifice teamwork to 'protected' their own grade, which is an understandable behaviour. Using pass/fail minimises this a LOT. Further, we see no evidence to suggest that people stop trying in COMP1100/7110 compared to other courses.

## MVP and pitch progress

⏱️ 2.5 hours - Group

For the rest of the studio, use this time to work on your MVP, your repository, and/or your pitch.

You have now almost 3 hours where all of your team AND your legend are available, and you can use this to make significant progress towards your project.

## Exit Ticket

You are free to leave *early* from the studio if you:

1. Show your legend your notes, etc., for the final presentation for week 13---you should be ready to present!
2. Demo your final MVP to your legend.
3. Show your legend the final repository, including the `iteration_3` tag.

If you cannot show these three things, then use this studio time to work towards one or more of these.
