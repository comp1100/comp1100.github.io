# Weeks 12-13: Presentations

In weeks 12-13, each team will give a presentation about their product during their studio. 

**TIME:** Up to 5 minutes per team.
* This is a **strict** time limit. You need to **practice** to ensure that you do not go over the limit.

**WHAT:**
* A 1-minute elevator pitch, target audience is ‘investors’, followed by:
* An extended pitch describing your project and your solution (up to 4 minutes). Target audience is not important: investors, users, customers, or even just your class members.


**WHO:** Every team member should present part of the pitch or presentation. One team member could present the pitch, and then others take part in presenting their production/solution. Alternatively, the pitch could be presented by many people.

**VISUALS:** 
* The use of visuals is up to you. You can use: slides, video, demo, or (if you are comfortable) nothing!
* We recommend that you present your product using a demo of your code (if you have it already), shots of a wireframe or paper prototype, or something similar.

**WHAT SHOULDN’T BE USED:**
* Don’t use a script (either on paper or device such as a phone/tablet) and read from it – it is terribly unengaging. Get some practice at presenting from dot points!

**WHAT WE CARE ABOUT:**
* This is about giving the teams a chance to share their project with the rest of the class, and to see what other teams have done.
* We are not assessing your ability to do public speaking.
* We are not assessing the quality of your product.
