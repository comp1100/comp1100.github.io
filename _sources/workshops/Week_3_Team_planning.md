# Giving (and receiving) Feedback

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 20 minutes - Individual

</aside>

There are many disambiguations for feedback including the fields of engineering, human behaviour, science, mathematics and so on. It is a pervasive term that usually refers to some form of self-regulating system. In its most fundamental form, feedback is defined as:

> Outputs of a system routed back as inputs as a part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop.
> 

When we consider feedback in the context of teams and software development, we are thinking primarily about the transmission of perspectives, information and thoughts shared as a response to individual outputs. In our heads, what we think has already been filtered by multiple layers before it comes out of our mouths. Feedback is just another layer of validation, but from another external source. 

Feedback is critical to modern software applications because of the growing complexity of technology. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to create commercially viable software applications as an individual without user validation, customer input or team refinement. Learning how to give and receive feedback thus becomes an important step in the software development lifecycle. 

The feedback model we are using is from Manager Tools. You can learn more about this system at the following link:

## Feedback is about encouraging future behaviour

The major principles of the Manager Tools Feedback Model are:

1. Feedback is about encouraging future behaviour, not about doing a post-mortem on the past.
2. Feedback is not about getting angry or punishing people.
3. Feedback is positive and negative: at least 80% of feedback we give to a person should be positive. Organisations seem to work effectively, which means most of us are going good things most of the time. Find those things!
4. Most people are desperate to gain feedback about how they are doing. Annual reviews (even quarterly reviews) are not feedback.
5. Feedback should be given regularly and quickly.

Item 1 above is important: we should only give feedback with the aim of ensuring effective future behaviour. Prior behaviour cannot be changed, so we shouldn't dwell on it.

## The Model

The feedback model consists of three steps:

1. Ask
2. Describe behaviour.
3. Describe impact.

<aside>
üìí Note: The model is the same for both positive and negative feedback. It is just what and at which time you mention each point that differs.

</aside>

### Step 1: Ask

The first thing we do is ask whether we can give feedback. If someone is not in the right state of mind or does not have the time (running off to another appointment), they may not want to receive feedback. It is fine to delay it, but not too long (we can't give feedback about behaviour from six weeks ago!). Keep it within one week at most.

It is also important that if we ask and they respond "No", we respect that. Don't ask for permission and then ignore someone's answer.

We should gain permission  whether we are giving positive or negative feedback! This let's them know that this is feedback about behaviour. Don't just ask when this is negative feedback, otherwise, people know that "Can I give you some feedback?" is going to be negative and will tense up.

By using the same/similar statement every time, it makes negative feedback much easier to handle.

<aside>
üì¢ **Tip:** Start this with "Can I" or  "May I".

</aside>

Some examples of how to ask:

- "Can I give your some feedback?"
- "Can I make an observation?"
- "Do you have time now to discuss some feedback?"
- "May I share something with you?"

### Step 2: Describe Behaviour

Feedback is about changing future behaviour. It is important that any feedback relates to behaviour, not to attitude.

Why? First, we can't see attitude, we can just infer it. So, we're much more likely to get it wrong when we point to attitude. If we get this part wrong, the feedback will be ignored.

Second, even if we do infer it correctly, people know that we can't see it, so they can just deny it.

Third, it is ok to sometimes have the 'wrong' attitude, provided our behaviour is still professional.

For example:

- Manager: "When you got annoyed at the client, it made us look unprofessional."
- Engineer: "I didn't get annoyed."
- Manager: "Yes, you did. You got really annoyed with the client. I could tell!"
- Engineer: "I wasn't annoyed -- I don't know what you are talking about".

This can go on and on for a while!

Instead, consider:

- Manager: "When you roll your eyes when meeting with a client, it made us look unprofessional."

This makes it much harder to deny. The engineer can say: "I didn't roll my eyes", but it is easy for the manager to respond: "I saw you roll your eyes."

Further, it is ok for the engineer to be annoyed at a client, as long as they behaviour professionally and effectively.

<aside>
üì¢ **Tip:** Start this part with "When you". This encourages us to focus on behaviour.

</aside>

Some examples of describing positive behaviour:

- "When you deliver everything on time..."
- "When you cover for someone when they are sick..."
- "When you reach out to let us know you will be late..."
- "When you make that extra effort to gather more data..."

Some examples of describing negative behaviour:

- "When you arrive late for meetings..."
- "When you commit to delivery on a date but don't deliver..."
- "When you sigh at people in meetings..."

### Step 3: Describe the Impact

Finally, we describe the impact that the behaviour had on ourselves or others.

By describing the impact, it helps people to understand the impact (positive and negative) of their behaviour, which they may not have noticed before. Further, if we want them to change their behaviour, we want it to be a new behaviour that does NOT have the same impact. If we want to keep doing something good, we want them to focus on achieving that outcome as well.

The impact doesn't have to be important or particularly large. Giving little bits of feedback ensure that we give feedback regularly, but also that feedback can be short and quick. Look for small impacts that people do well every single day, and tell them about it. Those small things will add up over time.

Mark Horsham from Manager Tools uses the analogy of driving a car. As we drive, we are constantly getting feedback by observing the road, feeling the steering wheel, and listening. As we start to veer off the road a little bit, we use the feedback that we receive from our eyes to adjust. We do this over and over again. We don't wait until we are nearly in a ditch on the side of the road. Feedback to people we work with can be similar. Thanks for doing the little things right lets people know: please keep doing this. Short negative feedback lets poeple know: please don't do this, but don't worry that you did it in the past.

<aside>
üì¢ **Tip:** Begin this step with "Here's what happens". This helps to focus on impact. Once you get used to delivering regular feedback, you can usually drop this part.

</aside>

Some examples of describing positive impact:

- "Here's what happens: It allows us to keep the project on track."
- "Here's what happens: It means that we can continue to deliver quality service."
- "It allows the rest of the team to re-plan."
- "I really appreciate it, and so does the rest of the team."

Some examples of describing negative impact:

- "We miss your input and it sometimes disrupts the meeting."
- "It puts the other project deliverables in danger, and annoys the rest of the team."
- "It makes us look unprofessional."

<aside>
üìí **Note:** Unlike in step 2 (describing the behaviour), in describing the impact, we CAN refer to attitude, emotion, etc., especially when it is our own. We can say: "When you do X, it really annoys me and the rest of team"; or "When you do X, it really makes me proud to be part of this team". People can't deny other people's attitudes, and for some impacts, they truly are emotional.

</aside>

### Pulling It Together

If we pull these steps together, we get the following template:

> "Can/may I... ? When you [behaviour], here's what happens: [impact]"
> 

Let's pull together our examples.

Positive feedback:

- "Can I give your some feedback?". "Sure". "When you deliver everything on time, here's what happens: It allows us to keep the project on track. Thanks."
- "Can I make an observation?". "Yep". "When you cover for someone when they are sick, here's what happens: it means that we can continue to deliver quality service. Thanks."
- "Do you have time now to discuss some feedback?". "Yes". "When you reach out to let us know you will deliver late, It allows the rest of the team to re-plan. Thank you."
- "May I share something with you?". "Sure". "When you make that extra effort to gather more data, I really appreciate it, and so does the rest of the team."
- "Can I give your some feedback?". "Not right now". "Ok".

Negative feedback:

- "Can I give your some feedback?". "Yes". "When you arrive late for meetings, we miss your input and it sometimes disrupts the meeting."
- "Can I give your some feedback?". "Sure". "When you commit to delivery on a date but don't deliver, it puts the other project deliverables in danger, and annoys the rest of the team."
- "Can I give your some feedback?". "Yep!". "When you sigh at people in client meetings, it makes us look unprofessional."

Read each of these to yourself. How long do they take? Each could be one under ten seconds. This encourages *regular* feedback because it can be given on your way out of a discussion, immediately after a presentation, or on the way past their workspace.

### Tips for Giving Feedback

1. If you can't do it with a smile, don't do it. We should be able to deliver feedback in a light-hearted manner; especially negative feedback! If we are fuming but the feedback really needs to be delivered, we should leave it until we have calmed down.
2. Focus on future behaviour. What has happened is in the past, and cannot be changed.
3. For positive behaviour, finish with "Thanks".
4. Keep it short: feedback should be able to be delivered within 10-15 seconds, once we have enough experience.
5. Deliver both positive and negative feedback in 'private'. It can be a public space, but ensure others cannot hear.
6. Try to deliver this in person, either face-to-face or on a phone/video call. Written feedback is okay if in person is not possible, but is not as effective.

### Tips for Receiving Feedback

When we give feedback to people, we assume that their intentions are good, and that, in this case, they had a small error or misunderstanding. It is NOT important to dig down into the cause of why. The person receiving it understands why, and they are mature enough to figure out how to change their behaviour.

As such, it is important to realise that when we receive a short piece of negative feedback, it is not necessary to defend ourselves (unless of course, it is an accusation of e.g. misconduct).

If we assume that the person giving us feedback assumes our intentions are good, then we can just say: "Thanks for the feedback". There is simply no need to get into a dialogue about this.

If you are giving someone feedback and they want to defend their actions, you can assure them that they don't need to.

Consider this example of shutting down a discussion about reasons:

- Programmer: "Hey, can I give you some feedback?"
- Designer: "Sure."
- Programmer: "When you are late to meetings, we really miss your input and it can sometimes be disruptive."
- Designer: "Yes, but you see, there was a lot of traffic today, and then I got stopped by a colleague on the way from the bus."
- Programmer: "Sure. I always assume that you have good intentions."

## Speed Feedback Exercise

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 20 minutes - Pairs

</aside>

Break into pairs. In this activity, you will practice giving fast and effective feedback on some simulated examples.

Below are 10 examples: 6 positive and 4 negative. Take turns coming up with quick feedback for these; that is, the first person does scenario 1, then the 2nd person does scenario 2.

You should be able to complete this task in just a few minutes! But we'll give you a bit more time.

**Scenario 1:** Your project was stalled because there was some unknown technical issue. Your partner spent the morning fixing it, without being asked.

**Scenario 2:** You need some information from your partner, who is in another team. You reach out to them, and within an hour, they responded with the information you need.

**Scenario 3:** Your partner was able to get a technical issue resolved quickly because they knew the technical support staff well.

**Scenario 4:** Your partner always takes good notes in team meetings and sends them around afterwards.

**Scenario 5:** Your partner keeps the project plan on Trello up to date by closing moving and closing tasks when they have completed them.

**Scenario 6:** Your partner uses branches and always checks in working code with tests that pass.

**Scenario 7:** Your partner has been 10-15 minutes late for the last two team meetings.

**Scenario 8:** Your partner committed to sending draft presentation slides the day before the presentation, but delivered them 20 minutes before the presentation.

**Scenario 9:** Your partner often dominates meetings by talking a lot and not taking the time to listen to others.

**Scenario 10:** Your partner is a high performer, but does all planning and delegates tasks to others without consultation.

## Positive Feedback Exercise

# Effective Team Planning

<aside>
‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes - Group

</aside>

Managing yourself is challenging enough, but imagine if each limb was its own person and the only way to control them is through an itemised daily schedule. Welcome to team planning.

Thankfully, with the advent of modern technology, team planning has become a little bit more streamlined and easier to manage. In this course we recommend the use of Trello, a free to use team scheduling and planning application.

> Trello is a web-based, kanban-style, list-making application developed originally by Fog Creek Software and later acquired by Atlassian. Trello can be used to create task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them. Typically columns include task statuses such as To Do, In Progress, and Done. The tool can be used for personal and business purposes including real estate management, software project management, school bulleting boards, accounting, web design, gaming and law office case management.
