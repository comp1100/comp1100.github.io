# Weeks 13: Presentations

In weeks 13, each team will give a presentation about their product during their studio. 

**TIME:** Up to 5 minutes per team. 
* This is a **strict** time limit. You need to **practice** to ensure that you do not go over the limit.

**WHAT:**
* **1-minute elevator pitch (1 min)**: Targetted at ‘investors’.
* **Extended presentation (up to 4 mins)**:  Your team describes your project, the customer problems, and your solution. Target audience is not important: investors, users, customers, or even just your class members. Target audience can be investors, users, customers, or classmates.

**WHY**: To build everyone's experience at presenting technical things, and to allow teams to share their achievements with the rest of the class.

**WHO:** Every team member should present part of the pitch or presentation. One team member could present the pitch, and then others take part in presenting their production/solution. Alternatively, the pitch could be presented by many people.

**VISUALS (optional but encourage):** 
* Slides are encouraged, but not too much text.
* Demo (live or video) of your product (if you have one already)
* Wireframes or paper prototype, or something similar.

**WHAT SHOULDN’T BE USED:**
* Avoid reading from a script—presenting from dot points is much more engaging and helps you connect with your audience. It will also not build your presentation skills as well.

**WHAT WE CARE ABOUT:**
* This is about giving the teams a chance to share their project with the rest of the class, and to see what other teams have done.
* We are not assessing your ability to do public speaking.
* We are not assessing the quality of your product.

**TIPS**: For a Great Presentation:
1. Rehearse with a timer to stay within the 5-minute limit.
2. Use short phrases or images to guide your speaking.
3. Practice transitions between team members.
4. Show enthusiasm—your passion sells your idea!
