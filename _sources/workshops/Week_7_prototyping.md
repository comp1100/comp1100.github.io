# Week 7: Software prototyping

## Studio Abstract

---

> In this studio, we will experiment with paper prototyping, and look at how to gain feedback from paper prototyping.

We will do the following  exercises:

- [ ]  Design and prototype a simple application
- [ ]  Gain feedback on the prototype from other teams
- [ ]  Use a digital prototyping tool 
- [ ]  Compare paper and digital prototyping
---

## The application: Keep in touch

⏱️ 5 minutes - Group discussion

We will use the product that is the running example discussed in the seminars: the `emergency alarm' system.

There are two main aims for the application that you will prototype:
1. Older people keeping in touch with the family members.
2. Families of older people knowing their older family member is OK each day.

You can choose the design of the system, but it has to support the following features:
1. Family members must be able to take and send photos from a mobile device.
2. Those photos must be shown on a digital `photo frame' or tablet in the older person's house.
3. The older person must touch the photo frame to see new photos that arrive.
4. If there is no photo by 11am on any day, show a previous photo that the older person has `liked'.
5. When the older person interacts with the photo frame for the first time each day, a notification is sent to the family members letting them know.

## Exercise 1: Paper prototype

⏱️ 30 minutes - Teams

Design an application that implements the above features and construct a paper prototype for it using the resources provided.

Note that you need to define BOTH sides of the application: sending photos, receiving photos, and receiving notifications.

## Exercise 2a: Feedback

⏱️ 10 minutes - Class

Now that each team has a prototype, two members of the team will take this to one other team, ask **each person** in that other team  to use it to complete the tasks of sending photos, receiving photos, and sending notifications.

Watch how the other team uses your paper prototype and see if there are design choices that would improve it.

Also, pay attention to how different teams have made different design choices for the same features.


## Exercise 2b: Feedback

Now, switch roles. Those who moved tables should return to their previous table, and the remaining members take the prototype to gain feedback for another team.

## Exercise 3: Digital prototype

⏱️ 30 minutes - Teams

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;"> Devices required for this exercise </p> 

The digital prototyping tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com) is an excellent tool for digital prototyping. It produces clean and beautiful interfaces.

Split your team into two sub-teams. Then:
1. One sub-team should create a digital prototype for the photo frame part of the application used by older people.
2. The other sub-team should create a digital prototype for the part of the application that sends the photos and received notifications. 

## Exercise 4: Discussion

⏱️ 5-10 minutes - Class

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;"> Devices closed for this exercise </p> 

The legends will lead a discussion about your experience. Think about these questions:
1. Which type of prototyping did you prefer? Paper or digital?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
3. When would you use one instead of the other?
4. Which was more fun?

## Exit ticket

You exit ticket is to have your legend use your paper and digital prototypes.
