```{admonition} Definition --- Value model canvas
A **value proposition canvas** is a visual description of our customer segments, and our value propositions to solve the customers' problems.

{numref}`fig:value_proposition_canvas` shows the structure of a value proposition model. It contains two parts: 
1. A **customer profile**, which describes the customers within a single segment, including their problems.
2. A **value map**, which describes the value propositions that potential solutions bring to that segment.

Value proposition canvases are used to define the value propositions and customer segments of a business model canvas. Effectively, for every segment, we map the segment to the value  propositions that solve that segment's programs. Therefore, there can be multiple value proposition canvases in a single business model:

## The four types of startup markets

When we are starting up a new product or company, there a four broad types markets:
1. Entering an existing market: The market is well-established and we are simply providing something with a different slant.
2. Creating an entirely new market: There is currently no market and we are establishing it.
3. Resegment an existing market as a low-cost provider: There is a well-established market, and we are providing a surface at a lower price than competitors.
4. Resegment an existing market as a niche player: There is a well-established market, and we are appealing to a niche part of the market via e.g. higher quality.

## Ground rules for interviewing customers

| Ground rule         | Explanation |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Adopt a beginner's mindset    | Listen with a "fresh pair of ears".         |
|                               | Avoid trying to interpret -- ask for clarification.   |
|                               | Explore things that you did not expect.               |
| Listen more than you talk     | Listen, don't tell.                                   |
|                               | Do not talk about what you believe.                   |
|                               | Clarify misunderstands, but don't try to to convince. |
| Get facts, not opinions       | Don't ask "Would you .?"                           |
|                               | Do ask "When is the last time you ?"               |
|                               | Do ask "How much did you ?"                        |
| Ask "why" questions           | Motivation matters and helps uncover new facts.       |
|                               | Ask: "Why do you need ?", "Why is this a pain?"    |
| Don't sell                    | We are not interviewing to sell a solution.           |
|                               | Don't explain our solution: "Wouldn't you like  ?" |
|                               | Ask: "What are the most painful . ?"               |
| Follow up                     | Ask for contact details.                              |
|                               | Follow up with more questions if we need to later.    |
| Always open doors at the end  | Ask: "Who else should I talk to?"                     |
|                               | **Always!**
