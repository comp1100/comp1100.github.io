# Subject Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**How will teams be allocated?**

Individuals will submit preferences for particular projects on offer, and for people to work with. Teams will then be allocation by staff, taking these preferences into account. People will be expected to work with people they don't know -- just like a real workplace.

**Can I do the project on my own instead of in a team?**

No.

**If it is pass/fail, how does it count to my GPA?**

If a student passes, the subject score is excluded from the GPA calculation.

If a student fails, the subject counts as a 2.

**What programming languages and frameworks will we use?**

Whatever is required for you to build your prototype! This is a real project, and you have the flexibility to make decisions about technology.

**I have a clash -- can I skip the seminar or studio and just catch up from my team?**

Unfortunately not. The seminar and studios are the place where the groundwork is laid for the project. They are also the only place we run ID verified assessment in the course, which is consistent with UQ policy.
