# Subject Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**How many people will be in a team?**

Teams will be mostly four people, except of course if the number of enrolments is not a multiple of 4, we will have some 3 person teams or 5 person teams.

**How will teams be allocated?**

Individuals will submit preferences for particular projects on offer, and for people to work with. Teams will then be allocation by staff, taking these preferences into account. People will be expected to work with people they don't know -- just like a real workplace. But we also give a chance for you to nominate one other person who you'd like to work with.

**Can I do the project on my own instead of in a team?**

No.

**If it is pass/fail, how does it count to my GPA?**

If a student passes, the subject score is excluded from the GPA calculation.

If a student fails, the subject counts as a 2.

**What programming languages and frameworks will we use?**

Whatever is required for you to build your product! This is a real project, and you have the flexibility to make decisions about technology.
We won't be teaching any of these technologies -- it's up to you to figure them out. But we also won't be evaluating how well you use them.

**I have a clash -- can I skip the  studio and just catch up from my team?**

Unfortunately not. The seminar and studios are the place where the groundwork is laid for the project. Studios are also the only place we run ID verified assessment in the course, which is required by UQ policy.
