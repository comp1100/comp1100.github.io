# Minimum viable product 


> "By far the dominant reason for not releasing sooner was a reluctance to trade the dream of success for the reality of feedback." -- Kent Back. Source: Approaching a Minimum Viable Product (August 2009)

```{admonition} Definition -- Minimum viable product (MVP)
A **minimum viable product** (MVP) is a version of a new product that contains the fewest number of features  (or least amount of effort) required to collect feedback about customers.

```


> "Youâ€™re selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set to visionaries, not everyone." -- Steve Blank


## Purpose of the MVP

Is it to:

Test ability of product to meet minimal customer needs

Get as much revenue as you can as early as you can

Identify bugs in product with a fixed feature set that meet a set of requirements
All of the above


## Principles for an MVP

**Principle 1:** KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!). Do not add "bells and whistles" -- just add enough features to test the hypotheses that you want to test.

**Principle 2:** Positive user Experience.  Although it is simple, make an MVP a positive experience for the people we test it on. It should be usable, simple, and intuitive -- remember that these people are our future customers!

**Principle 3:** Close the Loop for the user. Test an MVP that shows ours users what the final steps are of your MVP. Testing  out partial ideas that don't result in the user seeing e.g. the end of a transaction, make it difficult for them to see the value.

**Principle 4:** Iterate and Refine. Pay attention to user feedback and be prepared to refine this and iterate over it multiple times. It is rare to get everything right in even the first few versions.

**Principle 5:** Set success metrics. An MVP is still used to [test hypotheses](sec:experimentation), so set metrics for those hypotheses. It is not just something for users to play with.

```{admonition} Example -- Dropbox
[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) founder Drew Houston famously used a marketing video to demonstrate what Dropbox *would* do, before it was built, as a way to test whether there was demand for this product. He asked people to sign up and pay, and received 70,000 sign ups on the first day, which game him data to secure funding from investors.
```

## Types of MVP

**Pre-Order:** e.g. [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/). As in the Dropbox example above, asking customers to pay for a product before it is made is a way to test market demand. Kickstarter campaigns that don't reach a pre-set fundraising target don't go ahead, and customers get a full refund.

**Audience Building:** e.g. Social Networks. By setting up a strong social media presence, we can track whether people will be interested in our product.

**Show and Tell:** Explainer Video. Again, the Dropbox example above is an example MVP -- so simple, yet so effective.

**Prototypes:** Paper prototypes, Wizard-of-Oz prototypes, and wireframes can make excellent MDPs for software products. Tools like [Axure](https://www.axure.com/) can be used to build simple mockup MVPs that realistic prototypes with some basic functionality.

**Partial Product:** Implementing just some features of a product -- the most important ones --, such as landing page-single feature websites.


## Takeaways

```{admonition} Takeaways
1. A **minimal viable product** (MVP) has just the most important features to test our  main hypotheses.

2. We should keep them **simple**, **iterate**, and if possible, **return to customers** to test refinements. 

3. Different MVPs have different purposes, based on the hypotheses we test with them.
