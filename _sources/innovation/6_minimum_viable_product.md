```{admonition} Definition -- Minimum viable product (MVP)
A **minimum viable product** (MVP) is a version of a new product that contains the fewest number of features  (or least amount of effort) required to collect feedback about customers.

## Purpose of the MVP

```{admonition} Quiz

A quick quiz question for us all: *What is the primary purpose of a minimum viable product (MVP)?* 

1. To test ability of product to meet minimal customer needs.

1. Get as much revenue as we can as early as we can.

1. Identify bugs in product with a fixed feature set that meet a set of requirements.

1. All of the above.
```

Well, what did you answer?

All of these can be useful to us, but item 1 is the **primary** purpose of an MVP. Let's discuss.

The **primary** purpose of an MVP is to test our hypotheses.

If we test a hypothesis about market demand and this test *also results in us gaining revenue*, this is great, as it provides vital funding to continue with our efforts. However, our priority here is for having a valuable product in the long run. Knowing whether we have a product that meets customer needs *in the longer run* is more valuable during customer discovery than building a product that may not be suitable, but gets a few early wins. Of course, early wins are great, but they don't necessarily sustain us.

Identifying bugs in a product is also good, but as above: it is not as valuable at this early stage as testing whether our product meets customer needs.


## Principles for an MVP

**Principle 1:** KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!). Do not add "bells and whistles" -- just add enough features to test the hypotheses that you want to test.

**Principle 2:** Positive user Experience.  Although it is simple, make an MVP a positive experience for the people we test it on. It should be usable, simple, and intuitive -- remember that these people are our future customers!

**Principle 3:** Close the Loop for the user. Test an MVP that shows ours users what the final steps are of your MVP. Testing  out partial ideas that don't result in the user seeing e.g. the end of a transaction, make it difficult for them to see the value.

**Principle 4:** Iterate and Refine. Pay attention to user feedback and be prepared to refine this and iterate over it multiple times. It is rare to get everything right in even the first few versions.

**Principle 5:** Set success metrics. An MVP is still used to [test hypotheses](sec:experimentation), so set metrics for those hypotheses. It is not just something for users to play with.

```{admonition} Example -- Dropbox
[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) founder Drew Houston famously used a marketing video to demonstrate what Dropbox *would* do, before it was built, as a way to test whether there was demand for this product. He asked people to sign up and pay, and received 70,000 sign ups on the first day, which game him data to secure funding from investors.

Watch [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRZ_l7cVzzU?si=fR5R5_450jMKb618) from Michael Seibel, partner at [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and co-founder of [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) discuss how to build an MVP.

Seibel lists three important properties of an MVP:

1. They must be fast to build. We should spend weeks, not months, to build an MVP.
1. They should have limited functionality. We should implement just enough functionality to test out our hypotheses.
1. They should appeal just to the early adopters.

```{admonition} Example -- Airbnb
In the [video from Michael Seibel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRZ_l7cVzzU) that we reference above, he cites the example of Airbib --- a website for finding holiday accommdation rented out by individuals. Seibel notes that the original Airbnb MVP:

* Did not accept payments --- once a match was made, the owner and customer had to sort out payment themselves.
* Did not have a map view --- customers couldn't see a list of available properties on a map view; it was just a list.
* Insisted that owners rented out rooms with an air bed only!
* Was only set up for conferences --- that is, the Airbnb creators would find cities hosting large conference, set up a sit, and remove it again once the conference was over.

However, this Airbnb site was crucial for testing out the founders' initial hypotheses, which were presumable about whether a website that allowed people to list holiday accommodation would attract paying customers. 

I still don't understand the requirement of only giving air beds -- perhaps that was an early marketing trick.
```

## Types of MVP

**Pre-Order:** e.g. [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/). As in the Dropbox example above, asking customers to pay for a product before it is made is a way to test market demand. Kickstarter campaigns that don't reach a pre-set fundraising target don't go ahead, and customers get a full refund.

**Audience Building:** e.g. Social Networks. By setting up a strong social media presence, we can track whether people will be interested in our product.

**Show and Tell:** Explainer Video. Again, the Dropbox example above is an example MVP -- so simple, yet so effective.

**Prototypes:** Paper prototypes, Wizard-of-Oz prototypes, and wireframes can make excellent MDPs for software products. Tools like [Axure](https://www.axure.com/) can be used to build simple mockup MVPs that realistic prototypes with some basic functionality.

**Partial Product:** Implementing just some features of a product -- the most important ones --, such as landing page-single feature websites.


## Takeaways

```{admonition} Takeaways
1. A **minimal viable product** (MVP) has just the most important features to test our  main hypotheses.

2. We should keep them **simple**, **iterate**, and if possible, **return to customers** to test refinements. 

3. Different MVPs have different purposes, based on the hypotheses we test with them.
