# Course overview


## What is this course about?

### Course description
Introduction to innovation using computer science and information technology through a discipline-specific team project. Students will learn what innovation is, processes that innovators follow, how innovation teams work together, how to make decisions in technology projects, how to use prototyping in the innovation process and the tools required to successfully deliver and communicate an innovation project.

### Learning outcomes


After successfully completing this course, students should be able to

1. Work independently as part of a team with diverse backgrounds towards authentic IT innovation solutions
2. Apply innovation processes to open ended problems
3. Collect and analyse data about people and problems
4. Design and prototype innovation solutions to identified open ended problems
5. Communicate problems and solution to technical and non-technical stakeholders

### But what does this mean in normal words?

**What will I do?**
You will work in teams of 3-4 to build a prototype software system. You will follow an innovation process called **Lean startup**, which is commonly used in startups to ensure that they are creating products and services that people will actually want.

**Importantly** though, this course is about learning how to do innovation in a real environment. This will be a real project that you can take further if you want. You will gather data from real people. You will work in a real team with a real manager. The problem that you work on will be **open-ended**, which means that there are many possible ways to approach the problem, and no fixed criteria for when we are "finished". 

```{note}
Open-endedness is note the same as "vague". A problem can be perfectly clear, but still have many potential solutions that we can continue improving on for hundreds of years. A vague project is one where we don't know the problem. Part of this course will be your team figuring out what the problem is.
```

**This course is about real-world practice.**
In this course, we aim to emulate a real-world working environment. This means the following:
* There are no grades -- just a [pass/fail](sec:overview:grading). This is similar to an annual performance review -- either you are meeting expectations or you are not.
* There are no `answers'. The course staff don't know the solution to the problem you will tackle any more than you do. Your team is responsible for finding good solutions.
* You will work in a team that you are assigned to, rather than a group of  your friends (although I hope they become your friends).
* All members of the team will be ultimately responsible for the outcomes of the project; but by necessity, you will need to coordinate for individuals to lead different tasks.
* You will work under supervision of someone who will not make decisions for you, but will help you to figure out how to make decisions.
* You will have to make progress regularly; e.g. weekly, rather than just waiting for an assignment and then doing it all at the last minute.
* You will be asked to work in a professional manner.


**This course is about failure.** 

> "Good decisions come from experience. Experience comes from making bad decisions." -- Mark Twain.

> "We hire people who have experience not just because of their successes but also because of their failures. Failures offer learning opportunities and increase the chance that you won't make the same mistake again." -- Tina Seelig,

Time and time again, failure has been shown to be hugely important in learning. 

This course, and innovation more generally, is about trying things and failing. A strong focus on the course is: fail early. If we come up with an idea that we **think** is good, but isn't, how can we learn it is not a good idea before we commit a lot of resources to it.


## Why should I learn about innovation?

You may be thinking: but I don't want to run my own startup company -- why should I learn about innovation?

I believe that *everyone* should learn what innovation is, what innovation is *not*, how people innovate, and how to make innovative ideas into reality.

Further, innovation is *not* the same an entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is about setting up businesses. Innovation is about creating value. They are clearly related -- a business will not be successful if it doesn't bring value to people.  However, all of us can be innovative in our work, whether we run a startup, lead a research lab (like me), work in a large organisation, or even just at home. 

Innovation is about finding out people's problems and trying to solve them. You can do this internally within an organisation to bring value to other parts of the organisation. This is sometimes called **intrapreneurship**.

## Key elements of COMP1100/COMP7100

(sec:overview:legends)=
### Your legends

Each time will have a **legend** staff member that is assigned to help the team throughout the semester by providing guidance and feedback on how the team and individuals are going. These are similar to mentors, tutors, or demonstrators, but their role is very different in this course compared to others. They won't be grading you, they won't be teaching you -- they will be more like a manager within an organisation. They will be of such use to you that you will consider them legends.

(sec:overview:grading)=
### Grading

COMP1100/COMP7100 uses **competency-based assessment**, which means that it is **pass/fail course**. That means that you will not get a numerical grade from 1-7, as is common in course at UQ.

The grade is excluded from calculation of your GPA.

**Why pass/fail?** COMP1100/COMP7100 brings students together using an innovation process as a vehicle for getting teams to collaborate, learn about teamwork, innovation, and related topics.  As Jesse Stommel[^sommel2023] and others show, if students are immediately hung up on their grade and its effect on their GPA, then they focus on marking rubrics and on taking care of themselves instead of their team. This leads to dysfunctional teams. 

A pass/fail grading scheme avoids the class trying to fit their process and project to specific grading criteria, and instead engages students with learning the competency that is required frmo the course. Further, for many students in their first year of university, it can be difficult to tackle more open-ended problems and the ambiguity inherent in innovation projects, particularly under the pressure of a grade. A pass/fail grading scheme that rewards people for trying, failing, contributing, and learning, allows them to take risks such as setting goals they find challenging.

**So this means there is no assessment, right? No deadlines?!** No, sorry. Like any real project, we have deliverables and those deliverables have deadlines. Intermediate deadlines are important in projects to both ensure that the project is on track, and also to help motivate us (deadlines are known to be excellent at focusing people's attention).

**So I can just do well for the first 6-7 weeks and then stoping trying to get to 50%?** Nope, sorry. There are no grades throughout. To pass, you need to work consistently on your project, and with high quality.


**How will I know if I'm doing enough to pass?** If you need to ask that question, you are probably not doing enough. By this, I mean, if you are trying to game the system by putting in just the minimum amount of work, then yes, you risk failing. A pass is not doing 50% of the project -- it is doing all of the project. You can ensure that you pass by doing what is expected of you and trying your best.

Despite no grades, there will still be **regular feedback** on both teams and individuals as to how they are doing. Any individual who fails this course will not be surprised by this as they will have had multiple items of feedback letting them know that they are on track to fail.


### Assessment



### Communication

Communication between the class and the course staff will occur in a few different ways.

**General communication.**
First, the course discussion board will be the primary mode of asking general questions about the course; e.g. about deliverables, confusion about notes, etc. Anything that is about the course and not about you or your team should be posted here.

If you email course staff with a general question, we will ask you to post to the discussion board. If you have a question, it is quite probable that someone else in the class will have that same question.

**Communication of a team or personal nature.** If you need to communicate with staff about something sensitive about yourself or your team, you should contact the course staff. In the first instance, please discuss with your [COMP1100/COMP7100 legend](sec:overview:legends).

If you cannot resolve this or if your legend asks you to contact the course coordinators, please contact directly via the COMP1100/COMP7100 email address [COMP1100@eecs.uq.edu.au](mailto:COMP1100@eecs.uq.edu.au).
